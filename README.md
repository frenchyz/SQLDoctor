# SQLDoctor
Automated SQL Injection Tool 

Overview
SQLDoctor was designed and created in an attempt to automate the SQL injection process in various popular databases. Throughout the life cycle of the project we went through a multitude of iterations trying to both flush and flesh out numerous features to prioritize and maintain those that were critical to the framework. As of now the framework currently supports various SQL injection methods, ranging from fuzzing, to plain brute force.

Methods:
  Display- Welcome Display
  Fuzzer- Open Fuzzing Payloads and add them to a fuzzinglist and fuzzing Dictionary 
  OptHandler- 
  PostHandler-
  PullFromCSV- Parse payloads and fuzzers from CSV 
  URL Parser-
  
Flags
  -j URL parser
  -f add payloads from Pullpayload
  -L Help
